# Port_to_service_map
It is a bash script that will map the port to its default service.

It happens a lot of time when we are unable to remember a default port for a service. And that service is most of the times running on 127.0.0.1

In pentesting environment, these services can lead to privilege escalation or any kind of exploitation!!

The script gives info about all the services are are running on the internal server (if it running on the default port).
